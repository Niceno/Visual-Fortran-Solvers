You're right that a didactic approach to teaching these algorithms should start
with the most fundamental concepts and then build on them. Here's a suggested
sequence for teaching and learning these algorithms:

1. Gaussian Elimination

Start with Gaussian elimination as it is the most intuitive and straightforward
method for solving systems of linear equations. It's a direct method that
students can perform by hand on small systems, which helps build an
understanding of linear transformations and the mechanics of row reduction.

2. LU Decomposition

Once comfortable with Gaussian elimination, move on to LU decomposition.
This method is closely related, as it effectively performs Gaussian elimination
but stores the multipliers in the lower triangular matrix L. Emphasize how this
decomposition enables solving multiple systems with the same coefficient matrix
more efficiently than repeating Gaussian elimination.

3. Cholesky Decomposition

Cholesky decomposition is a special case of LU decomposition that applies to
symmetric positive-definite matrices. Introduce Cholesky after LU because it
reinforces and builds on the understanding of LU, but with the added efficiency
and stability that comes from exploiting symmetry.

4. LDL' Decomposition

LDL' decomposition is a variant of Cholesky that doesn't require square roots
and decomposes the matrix into a lower triangular matrix L, a diagonal matrix
D, and the transpose of L. It's a natural progression from Cholesky and is
often used when dealing with symmetric (or Hermitian in the complex case)
matrices that are not positive-definite.

5. Iterative Methods and Preconditioning

After covering these direct methods, it would be a good time to introduce
iterative methods for solving linear systems, such as the Conjugate Gradient
method, which is particularly important for large and sparse systems.
Discussing preconditioning strategies, including using the L and D matrices
from previous decompositions as preconditioners, can illustrate the connection
between direct and iterative methods.
