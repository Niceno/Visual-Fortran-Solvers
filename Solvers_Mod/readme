Interesting, each of these functions is called by only one demo program except
Solvers_Mod_Backward_Substitution, which is called by: Demo_Mod_Cholesky_Solver
and Demo_Mod_Gauss_Solver.

(This suggests that they might not be needed after all, I don't know.)

ChatGPT wrote this for LU decomposition:

subroutine lu_decomposition(a, n, l, u)
    implicit none
    integer, intent(in) :: n
    real, dimension(n,n), intent(in) :: a
    real, dimension(n,n), intent(out) :: l, u
    integer :: i, j, k
    real :: sum

    ! Initialize L and U matrices
    l = 0.0
    u = 0.0

    ! Perform LU Decomposition
    do k = 1, n
        ! Upper Triangular
        do j = k, n
            sum = 0.0
            do i = 1, k - 1
                sum = sum + l(k,i) * u(i,j)
            end do
            u(k,j) = a(k,j) - sum
        end do

        ! Lower Triangular
        do i = k + 1, n
            sum = 0.0
            do j = 1, k - 1
                sum = sum + l(i,j) * u(j,k)
            end do
            l(i,k) = (a(i,k) - sum) / u(k,k)
        end do
    end do

    ! Set the diagonal of L to 1
    do i = 1, n
        l(i,i) = 1.0
    end do

end subroutine lu_decomposition
